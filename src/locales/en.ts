      "The first-generation reforms aim to improve the country's economy. These reforms include the elimination of corruption and unproductive government spending, incentives for the creation of genuine and quality employment, opening up to trade, improving security and justice, and reforming the financial system. The ultimate goal is to eliminate inflation and achieve greater economic growth.",
    summarySecondGeneration:
      "Second-generation reforms: a social security system based on individual capitalization is proposed, administrative decentralization of the state towards a municipal orbit, improvements in the working conditions of state personnel, and the progressive elimination of taxes that burden production, profit, work, and entrepreneurship.",
    summaryThirdGeneration:
      "Third-generation reforms are related to the education and healthcare systems. The first aims to ensure freedom of choice and equal opportunities to access quality education in public or private institutions through the implementation of School Vouchers. The second reform aims to eliminate the mandatory affiliation to social security organizations, allowing workers to freely choose their health insurance or prepaid healthcare without minimum stay limits.",

      "1. Elimination of unproductive government spending and corruption.",
    firstGenerationContent1:
      "Corruption is not only morally reprehensible, but it also costs us up to 5% of GDP. Therefore, it is urgent to dismantle the mechanisms that make it possible. Additionally, it is necessary to simplify the procedures of the public administration, make it more transparent, and eliminate inefficient spending by implementing a new system of public and transparent accounting. Less tax pressure means less public spending, which implies greater economic growth. Less unproductive government spending means less monetary emission, and this also means less inflation.",
    firstGenerationContent2:
      "2. Incentives for the creation of genuine and quality employment, and reduction of taxes that penalize workers.",
    firstGenerationContent3:
      "Promote freedom of contract and the consolidation of a free labor market to increase wages and employment without harming acquired rights. Likewise, implement a forward-looking unemployment insurance based on an individual capitalization regime, in which each worker will make contributions while in activity and whose funds will be his exclusive property, disposing of them freely when he is unemployed or when he decides to retire from work. In addition, during the first stage of hiring, companies will have a strong reduction in employer contributions to encourage the hiring of workers on the books.",
    firstGenerationContent4: "3. Openness to trade to grow and reduce poverty.",
    firstGenerationContent5:
      "Free trade agreements with all regions or countries that wish to access our markets, promoting unrestricted respect for multilateral free trade in goods, labor, material and economic resources and favoring commercial exchange with all countries in the world.",
    firstGenerationContent6: "4. Security and Justice.",
    firstGenerationContent7:
      "Work on improving security and justice to reverse the growing wave of violence and insecurity that affects us. Revaluation of security forces. Promotion of measures that favor their better equipment and continuous professional training, in order to obtain greater effectiveness and efficiency in the fight against crime. Recognition of better working conditions. Promote a more efficient, free and independent justice system. Increase penalties for crimes committed with firearms from their mere exhibition, and deregulate the legal market for firearms to promote their legitimate and responsible use by citizens.",
    firstGenerationContent8: "5. Reform of the financial system.",
    firstGenerationContent9:
      "Reform of the financial system that allows progress towards a free banking and a free choice of currency, after the elimination of the BCRA. Elimination of inflation through the application of four stages. First stage: Moving from the fractional reserve system to the Simon Bank. Second stage: Free banking and elimination of the BCRA. Third stage: Currency competition that allows people to choose a monetary system. Fourth stage: Liquidation of assets and liabilities and definitive elimination of the BCRA.",
    secondGenerationContent0:
      "1. Reform of the pension system so that your contributions are yours.",
    secondGenerationContent1:
      "Implementation of a system based on individual, private, secure, and voluntary capitalization, whose contributions are managed by organizations freely chosen by workers.",
    secondGenerationContent2:
      "2. Promotion of administrative decentralization and streamlining of the State.",
    secondGenerationContent3:
      'Administrative decentralization from the national State to a municipal level inspired by the so-called "zero-base" criterion. Improvement of working conditions for State personnel through incentives. The salaries of public employees will increase or decrease based on their effectiveness and efficiency.',
    secondGenerationContent4:
      "3. Modification of the current tax revenue sharing system.",
    secondGenerationContent5:
      "To enable provinces to generate their own conditions for economic sustainability and not depend on resources provided by citizens of other jurisdictions through the national State. Gradually eliminate taxes that burden production, profits, work, and entrepreneurship, and that undermine economic growth. Specifically, the income tax on workers, Gross Incomes Tax, inheritance and donation taxes, check tax, VAT, and social security charges for workers to reduce informal employment.",
    thirdGenerationContent0: "1. Educational System.",
    thirdGenerationContent1:
      "No to indoctrination in education. The State imposes a single model of education that indoctrinates and undermines freedom of thought, which we cannot accept. Free choice and equal opportunities to access quality education in public or private institutions. For this, it is necessary to implement School Vouchers to guarantee access to both public and private education, and thus expand students' options to choose where to study. This will generate an optimization of educational quality through the competitive improvement of the entire educational system, in terms of content, teacher qualifications, areas to prioritize and develop, infrastructure, among other aspects, which will benefit students as the main beneficiaries. The Educational Voucher is a coupon that the State will provide to each student to access education in the establishment of their choice.",
    thirdGenerationContent2: "2. Health System Reform.",
    thirdGenerationContent3:
      "Elimination of mandatory health care. Unionism will lose its role as an intermediary in the provision of health care through Social Works and a free market of health insurance and medical services will be promoted, where the State will have the role of supervisor and primary responsibility for ensuring coverage for the least privileged sectors. Free and rapid transfer of contributions to the social work or prepaid health care that the worker prefers will be allowed without minimum limits of permanence, including workers in the public sector.",
